# NSM-25 Phase 1 Setup: COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: Ready for Parallel Agent Execution
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-20
**Phase**: 1 of 5 (Setup)

---

## Summary

Phase 1 setup infrastructure has been successfully deployed across all three domain branches. The system is now ready for concurrent 100-epoch training runs on:
- Causal Reasoning (NSM-24)
- Planning & Goal Achievement (NSM-22)
- Knowledge Graph Completion (NSM-23)

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Experiment Runner Scripts ✅

Created executable bash scripts for automated 100-epoch training:

**Causal Domain** (`nsm-causal/experiments/run_full_training.sh`):
```bash
bash experiments/run_full_training.sh [--use-wandb] [--use-tensorboard]
```
- Dataset: 1,000 scenarios (800 train / 200 val)
- Configuration: 20 relations, 5 bases, pool_ratio=0.5
- Targets: <25% recon, ≥75% intervention, ≥60% counterfactual

**Planning Domain** (`nsm-planning/experiments/run_full_training.sh`):
```bash
bash experiments/run_full_training.sh [--use-wandb] [--use-tensorboard]
```
- Dataset: 1,000 plans (800 train / 200 val)
- Configuration: 16 relations, 8 bases, pool_ratio=0.5
- Targets: <20% recon, ≥85% goal achievement, ≥80% temporal, ≥75% validity

**Knowledge Graph Domain** (`nsm-kg/experiments/run_full_training.sh`):
```bash
bash experiments/run_full_training.sh [--use-wandb] [--use-tensorboard]
```
- Dataset: 1,000 subgraphs (800 train / 200 val)
- Configuration: 66 relations, 12 bases, pool_ratio=0.13
- Targets: <30% recon, ≥70% Hits@10, ≥0.50 MRR, ≥60% analogical

**Features**:
- Automatic checkpointing every 10 epochs
- TensorBoard/WandB logging support
- Early stopping (patience=20)
- Timestamped experiment naming
- Complete result archiving

---

### 2. Results Infrastructure ✅

**Directory Structure** (created in all worktrees):
```
results/
├── causal_100epoch/       # Causal domain results
├── planning_100epoch/     # Planning domain results
└── kg_100epoch/           # KG domain results
```

**Cross-Domain Comparison Script** (`scripts/compare_domain_results.py`):
```bash
python scripts/compare_domain_results.py \
    --causal-results results/causal_100epoch/*.json \
    --planning-results results/planning_100epoch/*.json \
    --kg-results results/kg_100epoch/*.json \
    --output results/cross_domain_comparison.md
```

Generates comprehensive markdown report with:
- Training convergence comparison
- Domain-specific metric tables
- Parameter efficiency analysis
- Recommendations for Phase 2

---

### 3. Analysis Framework ✅

**Jupyter Notebook Template** (`notebooks/domain_analysis_template.ipynb`):
- Load and aggregate results across runs
- Training convergence plots
- Domain-specific metric distributions
- Cycle consistency analysis
- Best run identification
- Summary report generation

**Usage**:
1. Copy template to domain worktree
2. Set `DOMAIN` variable ('causal', 'planning', or 'kg')
3. Run all cells
4. Figures and summary saved to results directory

---

### 4. Agent Coordination Documentation ✅

**Comprehensive Guide** (`docs/AGENT_COORDINATION.md`):

**Contents**:
- Agent assignments (3 agents, 3 domains)
- Detailed responsibilities per agent
- Configuration specifications
- Parallel execution protocol
- Communication templates
- Resource management (CPU/GPU/Memory)
- Failure handling procedures
- Success criteria checklists

**Key Sections**:
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2 (Training)**: 🔄 READY TO START
- **Phase 3 (Analysis)**: ⏳ PENDING
- **Phase 4 (Comparison)**: ⏳ PENDING
- **Phase 5 (Tuning)**: ⏳ PENDING

---

## Agent Execution Instructions

### Parallel Training Launch

Each agent operates in an independent git worktree:

**Agent 1: Causal Domain (NSM-24)**
```bash
cd /Users/preston/Projects/nsm-causal
conda activate nsm
bash experiments/run_full_training.sh --use-tensorboard
```

**Agent 2: Planning Domain (NSM-22)**
```bash
cd /Users/preston/Projects/nsm-planning
conda activate nsm
bash experiments/run_full_training.sh --use-tensorboard
```

**Agent 3: Knowledge Graph Domain (NSM-23)**
```bash
cd /Users/preston/Projects/nsm-kg
conda activate nsm
bash experiments/run_full_training.sh --use-tensorboard
```

All three can run **concurrently** without conflicts.

---

## Resource Requirements

### Per-Domain Resources
- **CPU**: 4 cores
- **Memory**: 16GB RAM
- **Disk**: ~10GB (checkpoints + results)
- **GPU**: Optional (shared)

### Total Resources (Parallel)
- **CPU**: 12 cores total
- **Memory**: 48GB RAM total
- **Disk**: ~30GB total
- **Time**: 4-6 hours (CPU) or 1-2 hours (GPU)

### Sequential Alternative
If resource-constrained, run sequentially:
- Time: ~12-18 hours (CPU) or ~3-6 hours (GPU)
- Memory: 16GB RAM sufficient
- One agent at a time

---

## Expected Outputs

### Per-Domain Outputs

Each domain will produce:

**Checkpoints** (`checkpoints/<domain>_full/<experiment>/`):
- `best_model.pt` - Best model by validation loss
- `checkpoint_epoch_*.pt` - Periodic checkpoints (every 10 epochs)
- `results.json` - Training history and final metrics

**Results** (`results/<domain>_100epoch/`):
- `<experiment>_results.json` - Final results summary
- `<experiment>_best_model.pt` - Copy of best model
- `<experiment>.log` - Complete training log
- `<domain>_*.png` - Analysis figures (after notebook run)
- `<domain>_summary.json` - Statistical summary (after notebook run)
