**Status**: In Progress - Pivoting to Chiral Architecture

---

## Overview

This document records all major architectural decisions made during Phase 1.5 implementation, including rationale, alternatives considered, outcomes, and lessons learned.

## Decision Timeline

### D1: Adopt 3-Level Hierarchy (Phase 1.5)
**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Context**: Phase 1 (2-level) completed, ready to expand hierarchy
**Decision**: Implement 3-level hierarchy (L1 Environment → L2 Behavior → L3 Capability)

**Rationale**:
- Natural progression from 2-level proof-of-concept
- Maps to first 3 levels of validated BDI-HTN-HRL framework
- Manageable complexity increase
- Enables testing of multi-level pooling/unpooling

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Jump directly to 6-level hierarchy
   - Rejected: Too complex, harder to debug
2. Stay at 2-level and optimize
   - Rejected: Need to validate scalability

**Implementation**:
- Added L3 (Capability) layer in `nsm/models/hierarchical.py`
- Two pooling operations: L1→L2, L2→L3
- Two unpooling operations: L3→L2, L2→L1
- Cycle consistency at both levels

**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully implemented
**Cost**: ~8 hours development time

---

### D2: Run 100-Epoch Baseline Training
**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Context**: 3-level architecture implemented, need baseline performance
**Decision**: Train all 3 domains (Planning, Causal, KG) for 100 epochs on Modal GPU

**Rationale**:
- Establish performance ceiling with adequate training time
- Previous short runs (10 epochs) may have underfitted
- Early stopping (patience=20) prevents overfitting
- Parallel domain training efficient on Modal

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Train for 10 epochs (quick test)
   - Rejected: Insufficient for convergence
2. Train sequentially on CPU
   - Rejected: Too slow (days vs hours)
3. Train only one domain first
   - Rejected: Need cross-domain comparison

**Implementation**:
- Modal GPU infrastructure (A100-40GB)
- 3 parallel jobs (one per domain)
- Hyperparameters:
  - Epochs: 100
  - Batch size: 64 (Planning), 32 (Causal, KG)
  - Learning rate: 1e-4
  - Cycle loss weight: 0.01
  - Early stopping patience: 20

**Outcome**: ❌ **FAILED - Severe Class Collapse**

**Results**:
| Domain | Accuracy | Class 0 Acc | Class 1 Acc | Balance Δ | Interpretation |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| Planning | 43.3% | 1.8% | 97.1% | 95.3% | Severe collapse to class 1 |
| Causal | 57.0% | 100% | 0% | 100% | COMPLETE collapse to class 0 |
| KG | 52.8% | 28.9% | 79.3% | 50.4% | Moderate collapse to class 1 |

**Analysis**:
- All domains below random baseline (50%) or barely above
- Datasets confirmed balanced (50/50 class distribution)
- Model learning to predict majority class, not patterns
- High cycle loss (0.79-0.91) indicates poor reconstruction

**Cost**: ~$5 GPU time, 10 hours wall clock

**Lessons Learned**:
- Architecture has fundamental issue with class balance
- More training time doesn't help (converged to bad solution)
- Need architectural intervention, not just hyperparameter tuning

---

### D3: Implement Dual-Pass Architecture
**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Context**: Class collapse in baseline, hypothesis that dual predictions could balance
**Decision**: Add dual-pass mode with predictions from both abstract (L3) and concrete (L1) levels

**Rationale**:
- Hypothesis: Complementary perspectives (abstract patterns vs concrete details) could balance each other
- Ensemble methods in literature reduce bias
- Low cost to test ($2, 3 hours implementation)
- Non-invasive (parameterized, no code deletion)

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Add explicit class balancing loss
   - Deferred: Wanted to test architectural solution first
2. Adjust learning rate / batch size
   - Rejected: Unlikely to fix 100% collapse
3. Try different pooling ratios
   - Rejected: Already tested in baseline (0.13, 0.25, 0.5)

**Implementation**:
- Added `use_dual_pass` and `fusion_mode` parameters to NSMModel
- Dual prediction heads:
  - `predictor_abstract`: Predicts from L3 (after bottom-up pass)
  - `predictor_concrete`: Predicts from L1' (after top-down reconstruction)
- Fusion modes:
  - `'equal'`: α=β=0.5 (simple average)
  - `'learned'`: Attention-based weighting
- Multi-task loss:
  - 50% fused prediction
  - 25% abstract prediction
  - 25% concrete prediction
- Architecture remains compatible with single-pass mode (backward compatible)

**Files Modified**:
- `nsm/models/hierarchical.py` (lines 393-413, 459-497, 604-658)
- `nsm/training/trainer.py` (lines 151-191)
- Created `experiments/modal_dual_pass_validation.py` (350 lines)

**Outcome**: ❌ **FAILED - Class Collapse Worsened**

**Variants Tested** (4 parallel experiments):

| Variant | use_dual_pass | fusion_mode | cycle_weight | Hypothesis |
|---------|---------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| Baseline | False | N/A | 0.01 | Control (single-pass) |
| Dual-Equal | True | 'equal' | 0.01 | Equal weighting reduces collapse |
| Dual-Learned | True | 'learned' | 0.01 | Attention finds optimal α, β |
| Dual-NoCycle | True | 'equal' | 0.0 | Removing cycle loss helps task learning |

**Results**:

| Variant | Accuracy | Class Balance Δ | Findings |
|---------|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Baseline** | 43.5% | 98.9% | Severe collapse (control) |
| **Dual-Equal** | 43.5% | **100%** | COMPLETE collapse, WORSE than baseline |
| **Dual-Learned** | 41.3% | 72.4% | Only variant with any class 0 predictions (9.7%), but LOWEST accuracy |
| **Dual-NoCycle** | 43.5% | **100%** | COMPLETE collapse, SLOWEST training (47s vs 34s) |

**Cost**: $1.80 GPU time, 4.5 hours total (3h implementation + 1.5h testing/analysis)

**Failure Analysis**:

**Why Dual-Pass Failed**:

1. **Sequential Independence**: Streams never interact until final fusion
   ```
   Stream A: L1 → L2 → L3 → pred_A  (collapses to class 1)
   Stream B: L3 → L2' → L1' → pred_B  (also collapses to class 1)
   Fusion: 0.5·pred_A + 0.5·pred_B = still class 1
   ```
   Problem: Both streams collapse independently the same way. Fusion of two collapsed predictions = collapsed result.

2. **No Diversity Enforcement**: Multi-task loss trained all three predictions (abstract, concrete, fused) but:
   - All trained on same labels
   - No mechanism to force different perspectives
   - Gradient flows reinforced same collapse pattern

3. **Late Fusion**: Fusion happens **after both streams have already decided**:
   - Predictions already collapsed by fusion time
   - Too late to correct or balance
   - Need earlier interaction (at L2, not at final output)

4. **Cycle Loss Not the Issue**: Removing cycle loss (variant 4) made things worse:
   - Complete collapse (100%)
   - Slower training
   - Worse reconstruction
   - Proves cycle loss is not blocking task learning

**Key Insight**: Learned fusion (variant 3) was only one with any class 0 predictions (9.7%), suggesting attention mechanism at least tried to differentiate. This hints that **learned interaction** is valuable, but needs to happen **earlier in the forward pass**.

**Lessons Learned**:
- Sequential dual-pass doesn't work - streams need to interact during forward pass, not just at fusion
- Multi-task loss insufficient - training multiple heads on same labels doesn't create diversity
- Fusion timing matters - late fusion can't fix early collapse
- Attention showed promise - learned weights better than fixed weights

**Documentation**:
- Created `DUAL_PASS_ARCHITECTURE.md` (design document)
- Created `DUAL_PASS_VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` (complete experimental report)
- Updated `experiments/training_log.jsonl` (4 new entries)

### D4: Pivot to Chiral Architecture
**Date**: October 21, 2025
**Context**: Dual-pass failure shows sequential streams don't work, need simultaneous interaction
**Decision**: Design and implement chiral dual-trifold architecture with bidirectional exchange at L2

**Rationale**:
- Dual-pass failure **validates the need for early interaction**
- Category theory foundation (adjoint functors) suggests bidirectional flows should be simultaneous
- Chiral symmetry: two mirror-image processes that meet and exchange
- Minimal 3-level version testable in 2 hours
- Clear hypothesis: Exchange at L2 forces diversity before predictions are made

**Architecture Vision**:

**Minimal Version (3-Level)**:
```
Upper Flow (Bottom-Up, WHY):  L1 → L2_up
                                     ↕ (EXCHANGE)
Lower Flow (Top-Down, WHAT):  L3 → L2_down

Fused: L2_chiral = hinge_exchange(L2_up, L2_down)
```

**Full Version (6-Level Dual-Trifold)**:
```
Upper Trifold:  L1 → L2 → L3  (WHY: concrete → abstract)
                 ↓    ↓    ↓
               Hinge Hinge Hinge  (Chiral Exchange)
                 ↓    ↓    ↓
Lower Trifold:  L6 → L5 → L4  (WHAT: abstract → concrete, INVERTED)

Exchanges:
- L3 ↔ L4: Capability ↔ Beliefs
- L2 ↔ L5: Behavior ↔ Identity
- L1 ↔ L6: Environment ↔ Mission
```

**Key Innovation: Normalization Inversion**

Problem: Upper and lower trifolds have **opposite orientations**:
- Upper (L1→L2→L3): Increasing abstraction (high variance → low variance)
- Lower (L6→L5→L4): Decreasing abstraction (low variance → high variance)

When they meet at hinges, **their scales are inverted**!

Solution: Flip lower normalization to match upper scale:
```python
# Upper comes in normalized for its level
x_upper_norm = x_upper * upper_scale

# Lower needs INVERSE normalization for compatibility
x_lower_norm = x_lower * lower_scale
inversion_factor = upper_scale / lower_scale
x_lower_matched = x_lower_norm * inversion_factor

# Now they're on the same scale - can exchange
exchange = chiral_attention(x_upper_norm, x_lower_matched)
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Add explicit class balancing loss to dual-pass
   - Rejected: Doesn't address root cause (late fusion)
2. Try different pooling strategies (DiffPool)
   - Deferred: Architecture issue, not pooling issue
3. Re-examine dataset quality
   - Deferred: Datasets confirmed balanced, issue is architectural

**Implementation Strategy** (Staged):

**Phase 1: Minimal Chiral (3-Level)**
- Implement one hinge: L2_up ↔ L2_down
- Test on Planning domain
- Quick validation (10 epochs, $2, 30 min)
- **Hypothesis**: Even simple chiral exchange should reduce collapse

**Phase 2: Full Chiral (6-Level, if Phase 1 works)**
- Implement all 3 hinges: L3↔L4, L2↔L5, L1↔L6
- Add normalization inversion logic
- Test on all 3 domains
- Full training (100 epochs)

**Phase 3: Optimization (if Phase 2 works)**
- Tune exchange mechanisms
- Experiment with different attention heads
- Add interpretability tools

**Expected Benefits**:
1. **Solves Class Collapse Through Diversity**: With 3 hinges creating 6 different perspectives, impossible for all to collapse the same way
2. **Interpretable Reasoning**: Can trace how decision is influenced by each level
3. **Robust to Distributional Shift**: Different levels robust to different shifts
4. **Theoretical Elegance**: Chiral symmetry, adjoint functors, cognitive science grounding

**Risks**:
- **Technical**: 6 levels, 3 hinges, inversion logic - high complexity
- **Initialization**: What should L6 prior be?
- **Training stability**: Many components to balance
- **Conceptual**: Are we doing inversion correctly?

**Cost Estimate**:
- Minimal (3-level): 2-3 hours implementation, $2 GPU testing
- Full (6-level): 8-12 hours implementation, $5-10 GPU testing
- Total risk: ~15 hours, $12

**Expected Value**: **HIGH**
- Even if fails, learnings valuable (validates/invalidates early interaction hypothesis)
- If succeeds, breakthrough (novel architecture, solves class collapse, publishable)

**Outcome**: ⏳ **In Progress - Design Complete, Implementation Pending**

**Documentation**:
- Created `CHIRAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` (3-level minimal design)
- Created `FULL_CHIRAL_6LEVEL.md` (6-level complete specification)
- Created Linear issue NSM-31 (implementation tracking)

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement minimal 3-level chiral (2-3 hours)
2. Quick validation (10 epochs, $2, 30 min)
3. If successful: Implement full 6-level (8-12 hours)
4. If successful: Full evaluation on all domains

## Lessons Learned

### L1: Architecture Matters More Than Training Time
**Finding**: 100 epochs didn't help - model converged to bad solution (class collapse)
**Implication**: Need architectural intervention, not just more training
**Action**: Focus on architecture design (chiral) rather than hyperparameter tuning

### L2: Late Fusion Can't Fix Early Collapse
**Finding**: Dual-pass with late fusion (at output layer) failed because both streams collapsed independently
**Implication**: Interaction must happen **during forward pass**, not after predictions are made
**Action**: Chiral architecture with L2 exchange (mid-hierarchy interaction)

### L3: Learned Mechanisms Show Promise
**Finding**: Learned fusion (attention) was only variant with any class 0 predictions (9.7%)
**Implication**: Adaptive weighting better than fixed, but needs to operate earlier
**Action**: Use attention for hinge exchange in chiral architecture

### L4: Cycle Loss Is Not the Bottleneck
**Finding**: Removing cycle loss made things worse (100% collapse, slower training)
**Implication**: Cycle consistency is helping, not hurting
**Action**: Keep cycle loss in chiral architecture

### L5: Fast Iteration Enables Learning
**Finding**: $1.80 dual-pass experiment gave clear negative result in 4.5 hours
**Implication**: Low-cost experiments allow rapid pivots
**Action**: Continue using Modal for quick validation tests

### L6: Theory Guides Practice
**Finding**: Category theory (adjoint functors) suggested simultaneous bidirectional flows, which dual-pass failure validates
**Implication**: Mathematical foundations provide design principles
**Action**: Trust theoretical grounding for chiral architecture
