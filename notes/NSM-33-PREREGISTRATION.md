## Background

During 6-level chiral architecture validation (NSM-32), we discovered mathematical parallels between neural class collapse and plasma confinement loss in fusion reactors. This led to development of physics-inspired metrics for predicting and preventing collapse.

**Pilot Results (N=2,000 training samples)**:
- Baseline: 48.16% accuracy, inverted temperature profile
- Adaptive control: 53.68% accuracy (+11.46%)
- Fixed architecture: 57.82% accuracy (+20.05%)

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions

1. **Do physics metrics provide predictive advantage over simple heuristics?**
   - H0: Physics metrics have ≤50% prediction accuracy
   - H1: Physics metrics have >70% prediction accuracy (pilot: 85.7%)

2. **Does adaptive physics-based control improve training outcomes?**
   - H0: Adaptive control ≤5% improvement over fixed hyperparameters
   - H1: Adaptive control >10% improvement (pilot: 11.46%)

3. **Does correcting inverted temperature profile improve stability?**
   - H0: Temperature fix ≤5% improvement over baseline
   - H1: Temperature fix >15% improvement (pilot: 20.05%)

### Secondary Questions

4. Does physics-based early warning prevent irreversible collapse?
5. Are physics metrics robust across different dataset sizes?
6. What is the computational overhead of physics metrics?

## Theoretical Framework

### Fusion-Plasma Isomorphism

| Plasma Physics | Neural Network | Metric |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| **Safety factor q** | Class balance stability | q_neural = (diversity × capacity) / (collapse_rate × coupling) |
| **Temperature profile T(r)** | Representation diversity | T(level) = variance of features |
| **Lawson criterion** | Training success predictor | n·τ·T = diversity × capacity × time |
| **Confinement loss** | Class collapse | Δ > 40% imbalance |
| **α/β particles** | Information exchange | Hinge fusion parameters |

### Predictions

**P1**: q_neural < 1.0 will predict collapse with >70% accuracy (pilot: 85.7%)

**P2**: Inverted temperature profile (T_L1 > T_L3) causes inherent instability
- Pilot: All baseline epochs showed inversion
- Prediction: Fixed arch will normalize profile by epoch 3

**P3**: Adaptive control will make 5-10 interventions and improve accuracy by >10%
- Pilot: 5 interventions, +11.46%

**P4**: Temperature inversion is necessary condition for sustained collapse
- If T_gradient > 0 (normal), then Δ < 40%
- If T_gradient < -0.1 (inverted), then collapse risk increases 3x

**P5**: Q factor < 0.5 predicts final accuracy <55%
- Lawson criterion must be met for "ignition"

## Methodology

### Experimental Design

**Scale-Up Validation**: 10x increase (2,000 → 20,000 training samples)

**Three Conditions** (between-subjects):
1. **Baseline**: Fixed hyperparameters, no physics control
2. **Adaptive**: Physics-informed dynamic hyperparameter tuning
3. **Fixed Architecture**: Diversity regularization to correct temperature profile

**Metrics Collected**:
- Primary: Final validation accuracy, class balance delta
- Secondary: q_neural trajectory, temperature profiles, intervention count
- Exploratory: Training time, computational overhead

### Sample Size Justification

- Pilot: N=2,000 (small scale proof-of-concept)
- Validation: N=20,000 (10x scale, ~80% power for 5% effect size)
- Dataset: PlanningTripleDataset (hierarchical planning problems)

### Statistical Analysis Plan

**Primary Analyses**:
1. One-tailed t-test: Adaptive vs Baseline accuracy (α=0.05)
2. One-tailed t-test: Fixed vs Baseline accuracy (α=0.05)
3. Chi-square: q_neural prediction accuracy vs random (50%)

**Secondary Analyses**:
4. Correlation: Temperature gradient vs collapse frequency (Pearson's r)
5. Logistic regression: Physics metrics predict collapse (binary outcome)
6. Time series: q_neural as leading indicator (lag correlation)

**Corrections**:
- Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (α/3 = 0.017)
- False discovery rate (FDR) for exploratory analyses

### Exclusion Criteria

- Runs that fail to converge (loss diverges to infinity)
- Hardware failures or timeout errors
- Runs with <8 completed epochs (insufficient data)

## Pre-Registered Predictions (Scaled Validation)

Based on pilot results, we predict for N=20,000:

- q_neural: <1.0 for 60-80% of epochs
- Best accuracy epoch: 5-7

**Adaptive Control**:
- Final accuracy: 53% ± 3% (95% CI: [50%, 56%])
- Improvement over baseline: +10-15% (+5pp absolute)
- Interventions: 6-12 automatic adaptations
- Temperature: Remains inverted (root cause not addressed)
- q_neural: Stabilizes above 0.5 after interventions

**Fixed Architecture**:
- Final accuracy: 58% ± 3% (95% CI: [55%, 61%])
- Improvement over baseline: +18-25% (+10pp absolute)
- Temperature profile: Normalizes by epoch 3 (gradient > 0)
- q_neural: More stable (fewer drops below 1.0)
- Class balance: Δ < 30% after epoch 5

### Effect Sizes

- **Adaptive vs Baseline**: Cohen's d ≈ 0.8 (large effect)
- **Fixed vs Baseline**: Cohen's d ≈ 1.2 (very large effect)
- **Physics prediction accuracy**: AUC-ROC > 0.80

## Additional Isomorphisms to Explore

Based on pilot results, we identify potential connections to:

### 1. **Critical Phase Transitions** (Statistical Mechanics)
- Observation: Sudden collapse at epoch 2, 7, 9 (discrete jumps)
- Analogy: First-order phase transitions (discontinuous order parameter)
- Prediction: Collapse follows power-law precursors near "critical temperature"
- Test: Plot |∂Δ/∂epoch| for divergence before collapse

### 2. **Hysteresis** (Magnetism, Economics)
- Observation: After collapse, system doesn't immediately recover
- Analogy: Magnetic hysteresis loop (path dependence)
- Prediction: Recovery path differs from collapse path
- Test: Compare q_neural(Δ increasing) vs q_neural(Δ decreasing)

### 3. **Oscillator Coupling** (Nonlinear Dynamics)
- Observation: WHY/WHAT flows with α/β exchange parameters
- Analogy: Coupled oscillators (Kuramoto model)
- Prediction: Strong coupling (α, β far from 0.5) increases instability
- Test: Correlation between |α - 0.5| + |β - 0.5| and collapse frequency

### 4. **Information Thermodynamics** (Statistical Physics)
- Observation: Temperature = diversity = entropy
- Analogy: Maxwell's demon, Landauer's principle
- Prediction: Information loss in pooling cannot exceed kT ln(2)
- Test: Compare cycle loss to temperature profile changes

### 5. **Control Theory** (Engineering)
- Observation: Adaptive controller with cooldown periods
- Analogy: PID control with anti-windup
- Prediction: Optimal control gains exist (too aggressive → oscillation)
- Test: Grid search over intervention rates and cooldown periods
