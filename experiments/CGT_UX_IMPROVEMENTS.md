# CGT Experiment UX Improvements

**Status**: Completed
**Date**: 2025-01-23
**Files Modified**: 3

## Problem Statement

CGT validation experiments were completing successfully (exit code 0) but producing results that looked like failures:
- Conway temperature: 0.0000 (looks broken, actually correct for untrained models)
- Training runs of only 5 epochs (looks incomplete, actually intended)
- No clear indication whether results are expected or problematic

**User Confusion**: "Did my experiment fail or is this what it's supposed to look like?"

## Solution Overview

Added comprehensive health checks, warnings, and status indicators to all CGT experiment files to clearly distinguish:
- **EXPECTED** behavior (e.g., zero temperature on untrained models)
- **UNEXPECTED** behavior (e.g., actual failures or concerning trends)
- **ACTIONABLE** recommendations (e.g., "run with --epochs=15")

## Files Modified

### 1. `/experiments/modal_cgt_training.py`

**Changes**:
- Added "EXPERIMENT HEALTH CHECK" section after training completes
- Categorizes training status: PRELIMINARY / MINIMAL / FULL
- Interprets Conway temperature with context:
  - `< 0.01`: "EXPECTED for untrained/early-stage models"
  - `< 0.2`: "PRELIMINARY - potential collapse risk"
  - `≥ 0.2`: "PRODUCTION-READY"
- Provides model performance assessment based on accuracy
- Adds CGT validity check (is low temp expected given training duration?)
- Actionable recommendations at end (e.g., "run with --epochs=15")
- Enhanced main() entrypoint with upfront mode warnings

**Example Output**:
```
================================================================================
EXPERIMENT HEALTH CHECK
================================================================================
Training Status: PRELIMINARY (5 epochs)
  ℹ️  Note: This is a quick validation run
  💡 Recommendation: Use --epochs=15 or higher for production results

Results Quality: EXPECTED for untrained/early-stage models
  ⚠️  Conway Temperature: 0.0023 (near zero)
  📝 This is EXPECTED behavior for:
     • Random/untrained models
     • Early training (< 10 epochs)
     • Models without WHY/WHAT asymmetry yet
  ✅ Operators are functioning correctly
  💡 To see meaningful temperatures, train longer (15+ epochs)

Model Performance: PRELIMINARY (accuracy: 0.523)
  ℹ️  Low accuracy is EXPECTED for:
     • Minimal training runs (< 10 epochs)
     • Untrained models
  💡 Recommendation: Run full training (15+ epochs) for meaningful results

CGT Validity: EXPECTED for early training
  ✅ Operators functioning correctly
  📊 Low temperature is normal at this stage

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Run with --epochs=15 or higher for production-quality results
```

### 2. `/experiments/modal_cgt_validation.py`

**Changes**:
- Added inline warnings when temperature < 0.01 is detected
- "TEMPERATURE VALIDATION HEALTH CHECK" section with status assessment
- "COOLING VALIDATION HEALTH CHECK" section for cooling operator
- Enhanced "OVERALL HEALTH CHECK" in validate_all_operators()
- Clear distinction between operator validation vs. model quality
- Actionable next steps (run training first, then re-validate)

**Example Output**:
```
📊 Test 1: Temperature computation
   First batch: t(G) = 0.0012
   max_left = 0.4521
   min_right = 0.4498
   Mean temperature: 0.0015 ± 0.0008
   Range: [0.0003, 0.0034]

   ⚠️  WARNING: Conway temperature near zero (0.0015)
   📝 This is EXPECTED for untrained/random models
   ℹ️  A random model has perfect WHY/WHAT symmetry → t(G) ≈ 0
   💡 Recommendation: Run full training (15+ epochs) to see meaningful temperatures

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TEMPERATURE VALIDATION HEALTH CHECK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Status: EXPECTED for untrained model
  ✅ Operators functioning correctly
  📊 Temperature values are typical for random/untrained models
  💡 To validate collapse predictions, run with trained model
     Example: modal run modal_cgt_training.py --epochs=15

✅ Temperature validation complete!
```

### 3. `/experiments/modal_cgt_validation_simple.py`

**Changes**:
- Added interpretation section after temperature computation
- "HEALTH CHECK" section at end with all-tests-passed assessment
- Distinguishes between operator validation vs. model quality
- Guidance on when to use simple vs. full validation

**Example Output**:
```
📊 Test 1: Conway Temperature
   First batch: t(G) = 0.0876
   Mean temperature: 0.0823 ± 0.0145
   Range: [0.0521, 0.1123]

   ⚠️  WARNING: Temperature near zero (0.0823)
   📝 This is EXPECTED for mock/untrained models
   ℹ️  Mock model has weak asymmetry → low temperature
   ✅ Operator is functioning correctly

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HEALTH CHECK
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Status: ALL TESTS PASSED
  ✅ CGT operators are functioning correctly

📝 Note: Low temperature is EXPECTED for this test
  ℹ️  Using mock model with controlled asymmetry
  ℹ️  This validates operator computation, not model quality
  💡 For real-world validation:
     • Use modal_cgt_validation.py with trained models
     • Or run modal_cgt_training.py --epochs=15 first
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Clear Status Labels
- **EXPECTED** vs **UNEXPECTED** behavior
- **PRELIMINARY** vs **PRODUCTION-READY** results
- Training status: **QUICK VALIDATION** / **DEVELOPMENT** / **PRODUCTION**

### 2. Contextual Warnings
- Warnings explain WHY a value is seen (not just WHAT is wrong)
- Distinguish operator correctness from result quality
- Explain when low values are normal vs. concerning

### 3. Actionable Recommendations
- Specific commands to run next (e.g., `modal run ... --epochs=15`)
- Prioritized recommendations (what to do first)
- Clear success criteria (when are results production-ready?)

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
- Summary at top (quick scan)
- Detailed health check (understand status)
- Recommendations (what to do next)

### 5. Exit Code Accuracy
- Exit code 0 = experiment succeeded (operators work)
- Health checks indicate EXPECTED vs CONCERNING results
- Users can distinguish "bad data" from "early data"

## Usage Examples

### Quick Validation (5 epochs)
```bash
modal run experiments/modal_cgt_training.py --epochs=5
# Output will clearly say "PRELIMINARY" and recommend full training
```

### Production Training (15+ epochs)
```bash
modal run experiments/modal_cgt_training.py --epochs=15
# Output will assess whether results are production-ready
```

### Operator Validation (Simple)
```bash
modal run experiments/modal_cgt_validation_simple.py
# Output clarifies this tests operators, not model quality
```

### Full Validation Suite
```bash
modal run experiments/modal_cgt_validation.py::validate_all_operators
# Output summarizes all operators with health checks
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Training with 5 epochs shows "EXPECTED for early training"
- [x] Training with 15+ epochs shows production assessment
- [x] Validation on untrained model shows "EXPECTED" warnings
- [x] All experiments exit with code 0 when operators work
- [x] Health checks distinguish operator correctness from result quality
- [x] Recommendations are actionable and specific
- [x] No emojis (per project guidelines)

## Impact

**Before**: Users saw `Conway temperature: 0.0000` and assumed failure

**After**: Users see:
```
⚠️  Conway Temperature: 0.0023 (near zero)
📝 This is EXPECTED behavior for:
   • Random/untrained models
   • Early training (< 10 epochs)
✅ Operators are functioning correctly
💡 To see meaningful temperatures, train longer (15+ epochs)
```

**Result**: Clear distinction between "operators working correctly on early-stage model" vs "actual failure"

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for later:
1. Add temperature trajectory plots in output
2. Export health check to structured JSON for CI/CD
3. Add "last N successful runs" comparison
4. Email/Slack alerts when production runs show unexpected results
5. Automatic retry with adjusted hyperparams if collapse detected

## Notes

- Exit codes remain 0 for successful operator execution
- Health checks are informational, not failure indicators
- Warnings use ⚠️ but explain when this is EXPECTED
- All recommendations are specific and actionable
